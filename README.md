# Admin & User Wallet System

This project is a comprehensive wallet system with separate admin and user functionalities, built with Laravel. It includes custom permission handling, notifications, referral codes, and a JSON API for users.

## Features

### üîó Referral Code System
- **Admin Referral Codes**: Admins can generate referral codes from their dashboard
- **User Referral Codes**: Users can generate referral codes via API or web interface
- **Multiple Usage**: Referral codes can be used multiple times by different users
- **Latest Code Only**: Only the most recently generated code for each user/admin is active
- **Bonus System**: Both the referrer and new user receive 10 EGP when a referral code is used
- **Transaction Tracking**: All referral bonuses are recorded as transactions

### üí∞ Top-up Requests
- **User Requests**: Users can create top-up requests via API or web interface
- **Admin Approval**: Admins can approve or reject top-up requests from their dashboard
- **Automatic Processing**: Approved requests automatically add funds to user wallets

- **Admin Notifications**: Admins get dashboard notifications for new requests

### üè¶ Withdrawal System
- **Admin Withdrawals**: Admins can request withdrawals from their own wallets
- **Peer Approval**: Other admins can approve or reject withdrawal requests
- **Held Balance**: Withdrawal amounts are held until approved/rejected
- **Balance Management**: Proper balance and held balance tracking

### üìÑ Pagination System

- **Admin Dashboard Pagination**: All dashboard sections use pagination (5 items per page):
  - Pending Top-up Requests
  - Pending Withdrawal Requests
  - Sent Email Notifications
  - Users Registered Through Referral Codes
- **Independent Pagination**: Each section maintains its own pagination state

### üîê Authentication & Permissions
- **Separate Guards**: Admin and user authentication with separate guards
- **Manual Permissions**: JSON-based permission system for admins

## Database Schema

### Tables
- `users` - User accounts
- `admins` - Admin accounts with JSON permissions
- `wallets` - Wallet balances for users and admins
- `transactions` - All financial transactions (top-up, withdrawal, referral_bonus)
- `referral_codes` - Referral codes with owner tracking
- `notifications` - System notifications

### Key Relationships
- Users/Admins have one Wallet
- Wallets have many Transactions
- Users/Admins have many ReferralCodes
- Only the latest ReferralCode per owner is active

## Notifications

- **Email Notifications**: Sent for top-up request status updates
- **Dashboard Notifications**: Admin dashboard shows new requests
- **Database Notifications**: Stored for admin dashboard display

## Testing

Use the provided Postman collection (`wallet_system.postman_collection.json`) to test all API endpoints. The collection includes:

- User registration and authentication
- Referral code generation and usage
- Top-up request creation and management
- Admin dashboard functionality

## Development Notes

- **Referral Codes**: Can be used multiple times, but only the latest generated code per user/admin is active
- **Permissions**: All admin actions are controlled through the TransactionPolicy
- **Notifications**: Uses Laravel's notification system with database and mail drivers
- **API**: RESTful API with proper authentication and validation
- **Web Interface**: Bootstrap-based responsive design for both admin and user dashboards

## Security Features

- Separate authentication guards for admins and users
- Policy-based authorization for all sensitive operations
- Input validation on all endpoints
- CSRF protection for web forms
- Proper session management 

## Receive Notifications: 
  - All admins are notified in the dashboard when a new request is created. 
  - Email notification is also sent. 
  - The admin who created the request gets a specific notification (both in the dashboard & email).
